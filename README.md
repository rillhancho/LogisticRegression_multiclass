# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digits Classification using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits using the `load_digits` dataset from **scikit-learn**. We use **Logistic Regression** for multiclass classification and evaluate the model performance using a **confusion matrix heatmap**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We use the `load_digits` dataset available in `sklearn.datasets`. It contains 8x8 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), with each image flattened into a vector of 64 features.

---

## ðŸ§ª Steps Performed

1. **Load Dataset**
   - We import and load the dataset using `load_digits()` from `sklearn.datasets`.

2. **Visualize Sample Digits**
   - We plot a few digit samples from the dataset to get a visual understanding of the input data.
   - Below each image, the corresponding label is printed.

3. **Data Splitting**
   - We split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** using `train_test_split()`.

4. **Model Training**
   - We use **Logistic Regression** (with multi-class support) to train the model.
   - The model achieved a **score of 96%** on the test set.

5. **Model Prediction**
   - We use the trained model to predict the labels on the test data.

6. **Evaluation**
   - We create a **confusion matrix** to compare the predicted vs actual labels.
   - The confusion matrix is visualized using a **Seaborn heatmap**, helping us identify areas of strength and weakness in the model's performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Accuracy

âœ… **96% Accuracy** on the test set using Logistic Regression.

---

## ðŸ“· Confusion Matrix Visualization

The confusion matrix is visualized as a heatmap to understand how well the model is performing across all digit classes (0â€“9).

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python digits_classifier.py
   ```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Logistic Regression performs surprisingly well for this task, even though it's a relatively simple model.
- This project is a great starting point for experimenting with more complex models like SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
